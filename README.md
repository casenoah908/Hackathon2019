# Hackathon2019

  Hackathon was a competitive coding event held by Emerging Prarie, where participants would develop an application in teams within less than 24 hours. 
Since I had recently learned to use Android Studio about a month prior by working on my FargoEventBoard project (see repository), I figured I could teach 
my team (Me/Noah Case, Trevor Schmidt, and Noah Schottler) to use Android Studio as well. Hackathon 2019's project theme was to create an app involving mental 
and behavioral health. The actual relation to the subject was left quite broad so we could take our project in many directions. My team decided to create the 
beginnings of a forum app called RecoverTree for people recovering from different types of afflictions, from alcoholism, anger management, even depression. The idea was to provide 
an online Alcoholics Anonymous format that was adaptable to the individual user and their identified struggle. An intended (but not implemented in the time frame) feature 
was for a user to be able to filter conversation threads by different afflictions, whether they wanted to chat with others facing the same struggle or anyone in general.
On the home page, they would be greeted with their own custom recovery goal and a "days sober" count, indicating the number of days they have succeeded in their goal. The concept
in general certainly required some ideal situations (like users being civil on a site for people with sensitive issues), and not all intended features were implemented, but given
the amount of time we had to work on the project and given the fact my teammates were new to android studio, we are quite proud of the work that was accomplished. Finally, 
we did not get to implement a full user creation system, so if you would like to test out the app yourself, please use one of the following login options:
